According to the difference between real images and false photos, texture and statistical feature are extracted in different ways, this project trains SVM classifers with features below:

`DoG (Difference of Gaussian)`;
`LBP (Local Binary Pattern)`;
`HSV histograms`;
`HOOF (Histograms of Optical Flows)`.

The dataset used are:

`NUAA`;
`CASIA_FASD`;
`REPLAY-ATTACK`.

The features and datasets are combined with each other in different ways by setting control groups. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/NarcissusHliangZhao/Face-Liveness-Detection/tree/master/version/Matlab).

## Version
Face Liveness Detection is published in 3 languages.

`C++ Version`.
You can train your SVM classifier and deploy it on the server for work.

`MATLAB Version`.
You can train different classifiers by setting control groups and analyze the correct rate.
You can learn how to set control groups in this [page](https://github.com/NarcissusHliangZhao/Face-Liveness-Detection/tree/master/version/Matlab).
